* Debian Basic Config

This is some basic configs for debian post-install.

There's a script for set keyboard layout to br-abnt2 for those having trouble when setting this up.

- Basically:
  1. Download.
  2. Give +x permissions.
  3. Run.

You can also download the =keyboard= file and copy it to */etc/default* and run =setupcon= but you have to satisfy the =console-data= dependency first.
